# SIMD-0096 Reward full priority fee to validator

The SIMD can be viewed [on Github](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0096-reward-collected-priority-fee-in-entirety.md) and a governance [forum proposal](https://forum.solana.com/t/proposal-for-enabling-the-reward-full-priority-fee-to-validator-on-solana-mainnet-beta/1456) has been posted.

The stake weight gathering process takes place in epoch 616 and the voting process will begin in epoch 617 and last until epoch 620.

The token distribution occurs via merkle distributor (see this repo). Validators need to [claim](https://github.com/laine-sa/solgov-distributor) their voting tokens using their identity account.

## Key addresses and hashes

### File hashes

Verify the `feature_proposal.csv` file has a hash of `3972a374683e9fe9bf63ca179ae603ebf26e9cd5`

```bash
cat feature-proposal.csv | sort | shasum
```

Verify the merkle tree has a hash of `3678a96f40de4b6eec8eedbc26c9b731f502362b`

```bash
cat simd-0096-merkle-tree.json | shasum
```

The vote token mint address is `simd96Cuw3M5TYAkZ1d71ug4bvVHiqHhhJzsFHHQxgq`

The total supply will be `368296676892441006` with 1802 participating validators.

To reproduce the merkle tree:

```bash
./target/release/cli --keypair-path /any/funded/keypair.json --rpc-url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com --mint simd96Cuw3M5TYAkZ1d71ug4bvVHiqHhhJzsFHHQxgq create-merkle-tree --csv-path ./votes/simd0096/feature-proposal.csv --merkle-tree-path simd-0096-merkle-tree-to-verify.json
```

This will generate a merkle tree which you can then compare against the one published here.

## Voting

Claim your voting tokens using your validator identity account by cloning this repo and building the cli with `cargo b -r --bin cli` (you can also build and use the cli from Jito's original repository). You will need the merkle tree json file in this directory and your identity keypair file:

```bash
./target/release/cli --rpc-url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com --keypair-path <YOUR KEYPAIR> --airdrop-version 0 --mint simd96Cuw3M5TYAkZ1d71ug4bvVHiqHhhJzsFHHQxgq --program-id mERKcfxMC5SqJn4Ld4BUris3WKZZ1ojjWJ3A3J5CKxv claim --merkle-tree-path ./votes/simd0096/simd-0096-merkle-tree.json
```

You can verify your tokens are received with `spl-token balance simd96Cuw3M5TYAkZ1d71ug4bvVHiqHhhJzsFHHQxgq --owner <YOUR KEYPAIR>`

Cast your vote with `spl-token transfer` to one of the following addresses:

**YES**
```bash
YESsimd96Cuw3M5TYAkZ1d71ug4bvVHiqHhhJzsFHHQ
```

**NO**
```bash
nosimd96Cuw3M5TYAkZ1d71ug4bvVHiqHhhJzssFHHQ
```

**ABSTAIN**
```bash
ABSTA1Nsimd96Cuw3M5TYAkZ1d71ug4bvVHiqHhhJzs
```

`spl-token transfer simd96Cuw3M5TYAkZ1d71ug4bvVHiqHhhJzsFHHQxgq ALL <VOTE_ADDRESS>`

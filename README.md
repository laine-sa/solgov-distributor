# Solana Governance token distributor

This repository is forked from Jito's [Merkle Distributor](https://github.com/jito-foundation/distributor) and intended to be used for the distribution of vote-specific tokens for validator governance.

## Voting process

1. After a proposal completes its period on the governance forum a stake weight capture & verification epoch begins
2. Using the [SPL Feature Proposal CLI](https://spl.solana.com/feature-proposal) a CSV file with current stake weights is generated
3. A merkle tree is generated using this CLI and the CSV file and both are uploaded here in a directory under `./votes` named after the SIMD
4. The voting token mint address, CSV file, CSV hash and merkle tree hash are posted to the forum proposal post
5. In the subsequent epoch the tokens are minted to the distributor vault and the mint authority is burned, validators can claim their tokens and vote by transferring them to a designated account (also posted in the forum proposal)

## Verifying the CSV file
Please use the `check_stake_weights.sh` script to verify the CSV file against on-chain stake weight. This can only be done during the stake weight capture epoch as stake weights will change after this.

Usage:
```
bash ./votes/check_stake_weights.sh [OPTIONAL_RPC_ADDRESS] ./votes/simdXXXX/feature-proposal.csv
```

> [!NOTE] 
>Unfortunately `jq` behaves unexpectedly with some large numbers which will result in it showing a diff when there isn't one, usually of 1 lamport. If this occurs you can manually check that recipient in the CSV file against their stake from an RPC node using getVoteAccounts RPC call. Additionally occasionally validators abandon their vote account and operate a new one with the same identity key, the CSV file combines the active stake of both into a single row, while the RPC returns them individually, this can result in a diff, the sum of the two rows from the RPC should match the CSV file and the validator will receive the correct combined vote tokens representing their active stake across both vote accounts.

## Claiming voting tokens via CLI

You can either use the CLI from the Jito repository above if you feel more comfortable, or from this repository.

The changes in this repository to the CLI: 

- Adapt to the CSV format created from the SPL Feature Proposal CLI with validator stake weights, including removing UI decimal conversion
- Remove the unlocked token claim as there are no unlocked tokens and this creates a CLI error, add priority fee option to new token claim transaction

**If you use Jito's CLI tool when you claim your tokens you will get a Rust panic/error, as it tries to claim both unlocked and locked tokens, however there won't be any locked tokens. Ignore this and check your token balance with `spl-token accounts --owner <YOUR_IDENTITY>`**

To claim via CLI

1. Build the cli (must have rust (min 1.68.0) + cargo installed):

```bash
cargo b -r
```

2. Run `claim` with the proper args. Be sure to replace `<YOUR KEYPAIR>` with the _full path_ of your identity keypair file and `<SIMD>` with the SIMD number as well as in the file name of the merkle tree json file. This will transfer tokens to a the associated token account owned by your keypair, creating it if it doesn't exist.

```bash
./target/release/cli --rpc-url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com --keypair-path <YOUR KEYPAIR> --airdrop-version 0 --mint <VOTE_MINT> --program-id mERKcfxMC5SqJn4Ld4BUris3WKZZ1ojjWJ3A3J5CKxv claim --merkle-tree-path ./votes/<SIMD>/simdXXX-merkle-tree.json
```

## Casting a vote

To cast a vote, validators should transfer all their voting tokens to the destination address based on their choise of YES, NO or ABSTAIN (addresses will be shared in the forum proposal). You need access to the identity keypair .json file as well as the `spl-token` binary (Bundled with the Solana CLI or can be built from the [Solana Program Library](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library) with `cargo b -r --bin spl-token).


Cast your vote:

```bash
spl-token transfer <VOTE_MINT> ALL <VOTE_CHOICE_ADDRESS> --owner <VALIDATOR_IDENTITY.JSON>
```

You can add an optional note with a comment or motivation for your vote by adding `--with-memo "Comment"`

## Troubleshooting
If you have the incorrect version of Rust you can use `rustup` to set the default toolchain `rustup defautl 1.68.0`.

If you receive a Rust panic/backtrace while claiming, you may have used the Jito version of the CLI which tries to claim locked tokens, however it should have also successfully claimed unlocked voting tokens, verify your balance with `spl-token accounts --owner <YOUR IDENTITY>`
